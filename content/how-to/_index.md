## About the Game
This Hack-O-Lantern Game was created for the [Hack-O-Lantern Hackathon](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/7477-hack-o-lantern) with [MLH](https://mlh.io/). As part of the short time frame for development, imporvements will be made in the coming weeks as time allowd.  

In this game, you get to play a character in spooky story! You can choose from 2 options for each scenario and follow the story outcomes from those choices. In between the decision scenarios are short clips and collages that tell the story from your last decision to the next decision point.

**Disclaimer:** Please note that this game does have images and themes that may not be suitable for young children. This story is intended to be scary, but also not meant to reach the horror category. We want everyone who plays to feel comfortable with these conditions.

## Instructions
At each decision point, choose the action you would like to take for that given situation. If you die, you will have the option to start over. At the end, there will be an option to play again. And if you decide you don't want to play anymore, you can use the "Get me out of HERE!" button. 

*Hint:* A helpful resource for some decisions may be [Harry Potter Spells](https://www.mtv.com/news/1914360/harry-potter-spell-ranked-by-usefulness/)

Please note that this game will continue to evolve as time allows. Come back and check out some of those changes soon!
